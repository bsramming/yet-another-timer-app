# Yet Another Timer App! YATA

Yet Another Timer App is, you guessed it, a timer app!! :exploding_head:

## Why?

My goal for this project is to use it as a learning vehicle. It is a way for me to practice my programming skills and learning new languages along the way. And what better way to learn something new then with a concrete example. Plus Timers can be very handy!

# Goals

## High-level Capabilities

My current goals, at this particular point in time, is to create a timer app with this following high-level capabilities:

- Display a timer and show its progress.
- Run multiple timers in a sequence.
- Be able to define a group of timers.
- Provide an interface for creating new timers, selecting and running existing timers.

## Target Languages

Below are the list of languages I have in mind to try creating this app in:

- [ ] Python
- [ ] React
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Go

I have never used Rust or Go at this point. My plan is to start with Python which I have used before. But my plan is to take this opportunity to learn some new python modules: `rich` and `typer`.

Another goal I have during development is to learn about unit testing for each language.

## Future Ideas

- Playing a sound after a timer expires.
- Being able to record customer sounds!
- Threading / concurrency implementation.
